# Original concept for Boom Bay

## From July 19th 2021

**Description:** _A collection of island/island hopping combat game recreations and projects_

### Games implemented

1. Boom beach

2. Island builder, merge, attacker (concept that hasn't been done, but has been animated poorly many times)

### Languages to be used

1. Scheme

2. Python

### Codenames

See **[CODENAMES.yml](/CODENAMES.yml)** for a brief summary.

Expanded summary:

Boomer Beach was the original name, but it was later abandoned due to being unprofessional, and too close to Boom Beach.

Boomer Bay was an alternative name, but it was abandoned due to being unprofessional.

Boom Bay is the finalized name, which feels the most fitting.
